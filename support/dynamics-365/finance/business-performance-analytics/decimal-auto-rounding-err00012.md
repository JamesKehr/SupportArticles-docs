## Symptoms

Error code *ERR00012* is logged in the **Bpa self help logs** table in Microsoft Dataverse. This issue occurs when the decimal entries of certain columns in the final output of the dimensional model don't match the decimal limit of (19, 4), where `19` denotes the precision and `4` denotes the scale.

## Resolution

No immediate action is needed because this issue might be caused by a mismatch in the decimal entries.

Here's an example of a record:

This warning is displayed if the `GeneralLedgerAmount` has a value **922337203687.58097** and needs to be rounded to **922337203687.5810** to fit in DECIMAL (19,4) in the General Ledger Fact tables in the output dimensional model.
