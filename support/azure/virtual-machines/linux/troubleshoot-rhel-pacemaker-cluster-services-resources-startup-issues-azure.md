#  Troubleshoot issues related to cluster resources or services in RHEL(RedHat Enterprise Linux) Pacemaker Cluster Azure

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article describes the most typical reasons of startup issues for RHEL(RedHat Enterprise Linux) pacemaker cluster resources or services and guidance for determining the cause and resolving the issues.

## Scenario 1: Unable to start cluster service due to quorum

### Symptom 1

- Cluster node fails to join cluster after cluster restart.
- Nodes are reported as `UNCLEAN (offline)`
- Current DC shows as `NONE`

```Bash
sudo pcs status
```
```Output
Cluster name: my_cluster
Status of pacemakerd: 'Pacemaker is running' (last updated 2023-06-27 12:34:49 -04:00)
Cluster Summary:
* Stack: corosync
* **Current DC: NONE**
* Last updated: Tue Jun 27 12:34:49 2023
* Last change:  Tue Jun 27 12:29:51 2023 by root via cibadmin on rhel9a
* 2 nodes configured
* 9 resource instances configured

Node List:
* **Node rhel9a: UNCLEAN (offline)**
* **Node rhel9b: UNCLEAN (offline)**
```

- `sudo pcs quorum status` results in following error:

```Bash
sudo pcs quorum status
```
```Output
Error: Unable to get quorum status: Unable to start votequorum status tracking: CS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE
Check for the error: Corosync quorum is not configured in /var/log/messeges:
Jun 16 11:17:53 rhel9a pacemaker-controld[509433]: error: Corosync quorum is not configured
```

### Cause

The **votequorum** service is part of the corosync project. This service can be optionally loaded into the nodes of a corosync cluster to avoid split-brain situations. It's accomplished by allocatingÂ number of votes to every system in the cluster. Guaranteeing that cluster actions may only take place when a most of the votes are present. The service must be loaded into all nodes or none. If it loaded into a subset of cluster nodes, the results are unpredictable.

The following corosync.conf extract will enables **votequorum** service within corosync:

```Bash
       quorum {
           provider: corosync_votequorum
       }
```

"Votequorum" reads its configuration from corosync.conf. Some values can be changed at runtime and others are only read at corosync startup. It's important that those values are consistent across all the nodes participating in the cluster or votequorum behavior are unpredictable.

### Resolution

1.	Check for missing quorum stanza in `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf`. Compare the existing corosync.conf with any of the available backup present under `/etc/corosync/`

2.	Add the missing entry from any of the node present in the cluster.

Example for two node cluster:

```Bash
sudo cat /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
```
```Output
totem {
version: 2
cluster_name: my_cluster
transport: knet
crypto_cipher: aes256
crypto_hash: sha256
cluster_uuid: afd62fe2045b43b9a102de76fdf4659a
}
nodelist {
node {
    ring0_addr: rhel9a
    name: rhel9a
    nodeid: 1
}

node {
    ring0_addr: rhel9b
    name: rhel9b
    nodeid: 2
}
}

quorum {                            <------
provider: corosync_votequorum   <------
two_node: 1                     <------
}                                   <------

logging {
to_logfile: yes
logfile: /var/log/cluster/corosync.log
to_syslog: yes
timestamp: on
}
```

3.	Propagate the updated corosync.conf to the rest of the nodes as follows:

```Bash
sudo pcs cluster sync
```

4.	Reload corosync.

```Bash
sudo pcs cluster reload corosync
```


## Scenario 2:  Issue with VIP resource

### Symptom 1

Virtual IP (`IPaddr2` resource) failed to start/stop in pacemaker.
Below messages shown in `/var/log/pacemaker.log`:

```Output
14168 IPaddr2(VIP)[12083]:    2016/01/07_09:44:19 ERROR: Unable to find nic or netmask.
14169 IPaddr2(VIP)[12083]:    2016/01/07_09:44:19 ERROR: [findif] failed
```
```Bash
sudo pcs status
```
```Output
myip_start_0 on cluster0.heartbeat.example.com 'unknown error' (1): call=20, status=complete, exit-reason='[findif] failed', last-rc-change='Mon Jan 11 13:24:32 2016', queued=0ms, exec=39ms
```

### Cause

IPaddr2 call `findif()` function as specified in `/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/IPaddr2` (belongs to resource-agents package)  to determine which network interface to start the IPAddr2 resource on.

The correct NIC(Network Interface Card) will be determined by the options set on the IPAddr2 resource: `ip` (required), `cidr_netmask`, and `broadcast`.

*For example:*

Check the IPaddr2 settings,

```Bash
sudo pcs resource show myip
```
```Output
Resource: myip (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=IPaddr2)
Attributes: ip=192.168.111.222 cidr_netmask=24 
Operations: start interval=0s timeout=20s (myip-start-timeout-20s)
            stop interval=0s timeout=20s (myip-stop-timeout-20s)
            monitor interval=10s timeout=20s (myip-monitor-interval-10s)
```

Try to determine NIC information manually. In this example, based on the ip address and netmask, we can successfully find ens6 from route table.

```Bash
sudo ip -o -f inet route list match 192.168.111.222/24 scope link
```
```Output
192.168.111.0/24 dev ens6  proto kernel  src 192.168.111.195 
```
In case if the NIC (ens6) is down, we couldn't manually find the NIC information, and that might lead to `[findif] failed:`

```Bash
sudo ip link set ens6 down
```
```Bash
sudo ip -o -f inet route list match 192.168.111.222/24 scope link 
````

### Resolution

If the route that matches the VIP isn't in the default routing table, then one can specify the NIC name in pacemaker resource, so that it can be configured bypassing the check:

```Bash
sudo pcs resource update ip-172.17.223.36 nic=vlan10
```
```Bash
sudo pcs resource show ip-172.17.223.36
```
```Output
Warning: This command is deprecated and will be removed. Please use 'pcs resource config' instead.
 Resource: ip-172.17.223.36 (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=IPaddr2)
  Attributes: cidr_netmask=32 ip=172.17.223.36 nic=vlan10
  Meta Attrs: resource-stickiness=INFINITY
  Operations: monitor interval=10s timeout=20s (ip-172.17.223.36-monitor-interval-10s)
              start interval=0s timeout=20s (ip-172.17.223.36-start-interval-0s)
              stop interval=0s timeout=20s (ip-172.17.223.36-stop-interval-0s)
```
```Bash
sudo pcs resource restart ip-172.17.223.36
```
```Output
ip-172.17.223.36 successfully restarted
```

## Scenario 3:  Issue with SAPHana(High-performance ANalytic Appliance)

### Symptom 1

SAPHana DB fails to start with `'unknown error'`

- From the `/var/log/messages`, we can see `SRHOOK=SFAIL` indicating the cluster nodes are out of sync.
- Secondary cluster node is in `WAITING4PRIM` status.
- When you run `pcs status` the status of the cluster will be shown as following:

```Bash
sudo pcs status
```
```Output
    2 nodes configured
    8 resources configured
    
    Node node-1: 
    Node node-2:

     rsc_st_azure	(stonith:fence_azure_arm):	Started node-2 
            
    Failed Resource Actions:

        last-rc-change='Sat May 22 09:29:20 2021', queued=0ms, exec=0ms
    * rsc_SAPHana_start_0 on node-2 'not running' (7): call=55, status=complete, exitreason='',
        last-rc-change='Sat May 22 09:36:32 2021', queued=0ms, exec=3093ms
```
### Cause
Pacemaker can't start SAPHana resource when there are `SYN` failures between primary and secondary nodes.

```Bash
sudo SAPHanaSR-showAttr
```
```Output

```

### Resolution

SAPHana resource can't be start by pacemaker when there are `SYN` failures between primary and secondary cluster nodes. To mitigate this issue, we must manually enable `SYN` between the primary and secondary nodes.

> [!Important]
> Steps 2,3 & 4 are to be performed using SAP administrator account as these steps involve using SAP System ID to stop, start and re-enable replication manually.

1.	Place the cluster in maintenance mode

    ```Bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ``` 
2.	Check SAPHana DB and processes state. 

     -  Validate primary and secondary nodes are running SAP database and related SAP processes. Even though one node is designated as a slave and one node is a master, both nodes actually run a database. Master database is continuously synchronized to the slave database. In order to check if nodes can synchronize properly, we need to make sure that both nodes are correctly running the expected SAP DB(DataBase) and processes.
     
     - Run `HDB info` on each node to check the SAP related processes running in the node. SAP Admin should be able to confirm if the required process are running on both of the nodes.
      
    ```Bash
    a00adm@node1:/usr/sap/A00/HDB00> HDB info
    ```
    ```Output
    USER        PID   PPID %CPU    VSZ   RSS COMMAND

    a00adm     2008   2004  0.0  63796  2620  \_ (sd-pam)
    ```
     - If SAP DB and services aren't active on the node, ask SAP admin to Stop HANA DB in secondary node first and then in the primary node. 

    ```Bash
    'HDB stop'
    ```
    or
    ```Bash
    'sapcontrol -nr <SAPInstanceNo.> -function Stop'
    ```
      - Once the stop operation is completed, Start HANA DB in primary and then in secondary node.

    ```Bash
    'HDB start'
    ```
    or
    ```Bash
    'sapcontrol -nr <SAPInstanceNo.> -function Start'
    ```

4. Usually stop and start operation of HANA DB should synchronize both nodes. If we're still not seeing the synchronization, then we have to disable and re-enable replication between the nodes. SAP Administrator should be able to perform this step of disabling SAPHana system replication and then enabling the replication. 
> [!Caution]
> When reconfiguring replication on an existing SAP cluster, it's imperative that the database/node with the most accurate and up-to-date data is designated as the **primary**. A wrong execution of this process might result in an outdated or "empty" database being overwritten with the most recent database, leading to loss of data and a need to restore from any existing backup.

5. After enabling replication, check the system replication status as <HANA SID> account by calling the `systemReplicationStatus.py` SAP Python script. The SAP binaries are typically available as shown: 

   ```Output
   /hana/shared/A00/HDB00/exe/python_support
   ```

     From the primary node, check if overall system replication status: `ACTIVE`. 
If you're seeing a different message, then most likely there are other issues between primary and secondary, which needs to be sorted from SAP end.

    ```Bash
    sudo python /hana/shared/A00/HDB00/exe/python_support/systemReplicationStatus.py
    ```
    ```Output

   | Host  | Port  | Service Name | Volume ID | Site ID | Site Name | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary     | Replication | Replication | Replication    |
   |       |       |              |           |         |           | Host      | Port      | Site ID   | Site Name | Active Status | Mode        | Status      | Status Details | 
   | ----- | ----- | ------------ | --------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |

   | node1 | 30001 | nameserver   |         1 |       1 | node1     | sapn2     |     30001 |         2 | node2     | YES           | SYNC        | ACTIVE      |                |
   | node1 | 30003 | indexserver  |         3 |       1 | node1     | sapn2     |     30003 |         2 | node2     | YES           | SYNC        | ACTIVE      |                |

   status system replication site "2": ACTIVE
   overall system replication status: ACTIVE

   Local System Replication State
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     mode: PRIMARY
     site id: 1
     site name: node1
   ```


6.	You can also check the failover process by running SAPHanaSR-showAttr command in primary VM(Virtual Machine). If the SYN issue is resolved, then the output of this command shows Primary in Promoted mode and Secondary in Demoted mode. Once you see the primary and secondary nodes in Promoted and Demoted mode respectively, remove the cluster out of maintenance, this action allows pacemaker to start SAPHana DB.

    ```Bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```


### Symptom 2

SAPHana Resource Experiencing Start Failures with `hana_xxx_roles` Reporting N (Standalone) mode.
Database resource doesn't primary or secondary on either node. With `hana_xxx_roles` reporting **N** for Standalone node mode.

```Output

    * lpa_xxx_lpt                       : 1711641128
```

With migration summary reporting INF fail-count with failed SAPHana resource action reporting start failures due to "not running".

```Output
Migration Summary:
  * Node: Node1 (1):
    * SAPHana_Resource: migration-threshold=5000 fail-count=1000000 last-failure='Thu Mar 28 09:39:07 2024'
  * Node: Node2 (2):
    * SAPHana_Resource: migration-threshold=5000 fail-count=1000000 last-failure='Thu Mar 28 09:23:06 2024'

Failed Resource Actions:
  * SAPHana_Resource_start_0 on Node1 'not running' (7): call=97, status='complete', last-rc-change='Thu Mar 28 09:39:06 2024', queued=0ms, exec=1014ms
  * SAPHana_Resource_start_0 on Node2 'not running' (7): call=27, status='complete', last-rc-change='Thu Mar 28 09:23:05 2024', queued=0ms, exec=1024ms
```

### Cause

- Each database node in a standalone node attempts to function alone rather than interacting with one another.
- Commonly seen this issue occur when the database is altered (database manually stopped, started, replication paused, etc.,) while the cluster is in maintenance mode.
- Run `sudo pcs status --full` and check under Node Attributes for hana_xxx_roles and confirm it's reporting `#:N:X:X:X:X` instead of `#:P:X:X:X:X`.

### Resolution

> [!Note]
> These steps ( 1 to 5 ) should be performed by SAP admin.

1. Manually start the database outside the cluster on primary node. 

   ```Bash
   sudo HDB start
   ```

2. Initialize replication on primary node. 

   ```Bash
   sudo hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name=<site id>
   ``` 

3. Initialize replication on secondary node. 

   ```Bash
   sudo hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=<primary node> --remoteInstance=<Instance ##> --replicationMode=syncmem --name=<site id>
   ```

4. Manually start database outside the cluster on the secondary node. 
 
   ```Bash
   sudo HDB start
   ```

5. Confirm replications are running as expected by running the following on both nodes. 
 
   ```Bash
   sudo hdbnsutil -sr_state
   ```

6. Clear out fail count of SAPHana resource. 

   ```Bash
   sudo pcs resource cleanup <SAPHana resource name>
   ```

## Symptom 3

SAPHana Resource Start Failure 
Error message:

```Output
'FAIL: process hdbdaemon HDB Daemon not running'
```

### Cause

1 Run `pcs status --full` and collect the time frame the start error occurred under "Failed Resource Actions."

```Output
Failed Resource Actions:
  * SAPHana_ECR_00_start_0 on Node1 'error' (1): call=44, status='complete', exitreason='', last-rc-change='2024-03-01 02:27:33 -08:00', queued=0ms, exec=23727ms
```

2 Check messages log at the time of the Start failure for a similar block of messages.

### Resolution

Open a case with SAP Hana to investigate why hdbdaemon didn't start.

## Scenario 4: Issue with ASCS and ERS resource.

## Symptom 1
ASCS and ERS instances aren't able to start under cluster control. The following errors can be seen from `/var/log/messages`.

```Output
Apr  6 23:29:16 nodeci SAPRh2_10[340480]: Unable to change to Directory /usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/work. (Error 2 No such file or directory) [ntservsserver.cpp 3845]
Apr  6 23:29:16 nodeci SAPRH2_00[340486]: Unable to change to Directory /usr/sap/Rh2/ASCS00/work. (Error 2 No such file or directory) [ntservsserver.cpp 3845]
```

### Cause

Due to incorrect `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` attributes SAP instance (ASCS & ERS) not start under cluster control.

### Resolution

> [!Note]
> This resolution is applicable when your `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` are individual.

1 Verify the `pf(profile)` path from `/usr/sap/sapservices` file:

```Bash
sudo cat /usr/sap/sapservices
```
```Output
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/RH2/ASCS00/exe:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH;/usr/sap/RH2/ASCS00/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/RH2/SYS/profile/START_ASCS00_nodeci -D -u rh2adm
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/exe:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH;/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/profile/START_ERS10_nodersvi -D -u rh2adm
```


2 Correct the `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` attribute values in a cluster configuration resource agent SAPInstance 

**Example:**

```Bash
sudo pcs resource update ASCS_RH2_ASCS00 InstanceName=RH2_ASCS00_nodeci START_PROFILE=/usr/sap/RH2/SYS/profile/START_ASCS00_nodeci
```
```Bash
sudo pcs resource update ERS_RH2_ERS10 InstanceName=RH2_ERS10_nodersvi START_PROFILE=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/profile/START_ERS10_nodersvi
```

> [!Note]
> For above commands use `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` path details as per your setup.
